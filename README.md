Cloth Simulator made by Holden Bowlds and Caden Toczek.

This cloth simulator utilizes a system of particles with mass connected to each other by springs. 
Leapfrog physics are used to calculate the change in position and velocity of each particle based
on gravity, spring forces using Hooke's Law, and wind.
